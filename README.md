# Friendlier

Friendlier: A social network for people to be friendly! This Django Web application allows users to make wholesome text and image posts and comment to support others. To access Friendlier visit [https://friendlier.pythonanywhere.com/](https://friendlier.pythonanywhere.com/)! Without an account, visitors can see all existing public posts/comments and view content from all users. After signing up, users can make supportive comments on others' posts and make their own image and/or text posts.

## Motivation

The idea for Friendlier came to me following my own experiences on social media. I have not been active on social media for years because of the way it affected me. I previously obsessed over numbers, such as followers and likes, despite the fact that these factors are beyond my control. Certain apps also used clever tricks to keep me hooked, serving a never-ending barage of content. In March of 2021, the [HooHacks 2021](https://www.hoohacks.io/) hackathon was held at UVA, and I decided that I would try my hand at addressing some of these social media issues. I had also spent much of my winter break learning about Django and full-stack web development, so this felt like a perfect project to practice and relearn my skills. Because of this, I built this full-stack application by myself in an evening and a morning, taking around 8 hours of the 24-hour limit imposed by the hackathon organizers.

## Technology
- On the backend, this site uses [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), a Python web development framework. 
- [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), a small SQL database engine, was used to persist data for the site.
- Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used on the frontend to create structure, styling, and interactivity on the client side.
